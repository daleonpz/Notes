L1 cache size : 32K
L2 cache size : 256K
L3 cache size : 4M

when s1 it hard to determine the cache sizes since the values are similar,
but the size in which the RAM starts working it's at 8M.

However, if we analyze the performance for different "s", we can observe that
after 32K there is a drop in performance so it means that L1 cache has reached
its limit. The second drop was at 128K, and the third at 4M.
