# Ch01: Preface
- **Tip 01**: Care About your craft: do it well
- **Tip 02**: Think! about your work: never run on auto-pilot. Think on what you are doing
    - It's a continous process: continously small improvements
    - Take responsability: When you do accept the responsibility for an outcome, you should expect to be held accountable for it. When you make a mistake (as we all do) or an error in judgment, admit it honestly and try to offer options.  Don't blame someone or something else, or make up an excuse. Don't blame all the problems on a vendor, a programming language, management, or your coworkers. Any and all of these may play a role, but it is up to you to provide solutions, not excuses. 
- **Tip 03**: Provide Options, don't make lame excuses
    - Software entrophy:
        - Entrophy hits software hard
        - When disorder increases in software, programmers call it "software rot."
        - The most important factor for software rot is psychology or culture at work on a project
    - The **broken window theory** One broken window, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time, instills in the inhabitants of the building a sense of abandonment—a sense that the powers that be don't care about the building. So another window gets broken. People start littering. Graffiti appears. Serious structural damage begins. In a relatively short space of time, the building becomes damaged beyond the owner's desire to fix it, and the sense of abandonment becomes reality. 

- **Tip 04**: Don't live with broken windows
    - Don't leave "broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired. Fix each one as soon as it is discovered. If there is insufficient time to fix it perhaps you can comment out the offending code.
    - Putting out Fires:
        - If you find yourself working on a project with quite a few broken windows, it's all too easy to slip into the mindset of "All the rest of this code is crap, I'll just follow suit." It doesn't matter if the project has been fine up to this point. 
        - By the same token, if you find yourself on a team and a project where the code is pristinely beautiful—cleanly written, well designed, and elegant—you will likely take extra special care not to mess it up. Even if there's a fire raging (deadline, release date, trade show demo, etc.), you don't want to be the first one to make a mess.
