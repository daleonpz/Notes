# Ch01: Preface
- **Tip 01**: Care About your craft: do it well
- **Tip 02**: Think! about your work: never run on auto-pilot. Think on what you are doing
- It's a continous process: continously small improvements
- Take responsability: When you do accept the responsibility for an outcome, you should expect to be held accountable for it. When you make a mistake (as we all do) or an error in judgment, admit it honestly and try to offer options.  Don't blame someone or something else, or make up an excuse. Don't blame all the problems on a vendor, a programming language, management, or your coworkers. Any and all of these may play a role, but it is up to you to provide solutions, not excuses. 
- **Tip 03**: Provide Options, don't make lame excuses
