1. if you understand what motivates people to talk and to share then you can get them to talk and share with your goals in mind
2. Perception techniques are more efficient in social median than anywhere else
3. If you know what to look for you can easily identify when a person is in a state of low emotional stability so that you know when to escalate the relationship and scale your efforts at adding value.

# The Cast
## Carpenter ants
They are everywhere in the shadows, following you, learning from you but unwilling to buy anything from you but they might know someone who will.
They will spread your message, but you need to identify your **road builders**.

## Road builders
People very interested in the industry, and what they do have an important impact on the industry. 
But these people share what you do because they like what you do, and they love to learn about some topic.

## The Sea lion 
Connect with people who actively participate on the community or niche you want. 
Follow your competition to find these persons.
Success is achieved by finding those that are willing and eager to share, comment, and “like” your work. Not
everybody will, despite your best efforts.

## The Diamonds in the Rough
Work with others in the community.
Who in the media has written about influential people in your industry? They are your targets.

## The Expert is “the Guy”
the guy is able to be in the right place at the right time and has a knack for articulating the spoken and unspoken desires of others who share his or her expertise clearly, eloquently, and consistently, and becomes the voice of the network.

# What's going on
- Your job, in other words, is less about getting folk to do stuff and more about helping them to get each other to do stuff and so on through the population.

- All you have to do is get the right type of person to select you.

- Don’t try to change people’s minds right away. Instead, appeal to those who already agree with you or your position.

- Feeds are turning into reverse search engines showing you what you want to see before you think to ask.

- Information is shared for three main reasons: 1. It’s funny / nice to watch, 2. The person sharing wants to become part of a group or strengthen their position within one; and 3. The person sharing is either consciously or sub consciously using the information to selectively self represent (This is driven by emotions)

- Users trust the people providing information within their feeds.

- People find what they’re looking for by scanning their feeds or asking their friends.

# Starting out to put the pieces in place
the power of a network is directly correlated to the square of the number of nodes on that network. Marketing, any kind of marketing, is about staying at the top of someone’s mind for long enough so that when they decide to buy, you’re the first person they think of.

- Actively promote someone else every day to get into his/her network.
- Be consistent and always be helpful, keep you active

The biggest mistake that the owner of a business professional page can make is to put the focus on the business or brand and not on the message or idea that it represents.

Add value to your clients, information is everywhere but you may ship this information to be funnier or easier to understand

Every action that’s taken online is driven by the powerful desire to appear:
- Intelligent
- Intellectual
- Interesting
- Attractive
- Funny.

If I think that you think that I’m smart, I get a shot of dopamine and I feel good even if you actually think that I’m stupid.

People want to be heard, but they need a voice to articulate their thoughts and desires for them.

Status updates were published when the sharer was in a state of emotional instability.

Learning to identify the times when your friend group is reaching out for help and being the one to provide it will put you in a powerful position.

**“Why do people share?”**  People are projecting where they are, who they want others to think they are, and what they want others to think they like. The trick is to make them speak about you using whatever means they have.

**Why do you do what you do**, people will use your words as they were theirs, because they can't do it by themselves

# Influence
1. True power doesn’t come from knowing. It comes from knowing where to find.
2. True power is maintaining a position of control where everybody owes you one, and not vice-versa.

When developing your message, it’s not a matter of how many buttons you push or how many messages you put out, what matters is that you push the exact right button at the exact right time.

Reduce the number of steps as much as possible to help them get precisely what they want.

What do your prospects really desire?

they will share your post simply because it’s easier than creating their own.

Based off of what we’ve spoken about so far, I have two conclusions of note:
1. Those who can figure out how to stay in the feed longer, not by trying to appeal to potential customers but by appealing to those who already agree with them, will win.
2. We’ve entered the age of the coach. The most valuable asset that any marketer can have is not to provide information, but to become a trusted entity so that they become “the guy” when someone is looking for a solution to their specific problem.

Emotion drives action; logic justifies it. Target emotion first. To target emotion, identify the benefits of your product or service.

Every piece of marketing material that you put out needs to include the following three attributes in order:
1. Emotion/benefits (financial, health, love, security, salvation, self-regard, community and peer recognition, independence, sexual fulfillment, self-care). Address at least one of these beneficts with you **ask**.
2. Value/steps to solving. Give valuable information that helps your prospect solve their problem.
3. Logic/features. Show proofs, testimonials.

Basically **Why, How, What**

**The Formula**
Every good status update follows the same basic formula:
1. Headline
2. Lede
3. Steps to solving
4. Call to action

we have a tendency to believe and trust information that’s easier to process.
Emotional sharing is what pushes content online. The last line of whatever message you create needs to stir
something in your reader. It could be food for thought, a strong quote, a smile, or it could make him or her angry.

# Tactics
Once someone hits your site they need to know four things within less than a second:
1. What it is.
2. Who the site is for.
3. How they will benefit.
4. Why they should care.

If you’re new, there’s no point in publishing a ton of valueladen material because no one will see it. Revisit your ratio of value : viral : action I’ve discussed a few times in this book. When you’re starting out, post less and promote more.

Find groups related to your niche and network, attend events, reach out to other bloggers and add value, do anything you can to get an audience back to your site.

Problem + solution = post. Makes sense to me.

1. Tell a story (make it personal).
2. Highlight the problem from the story.
3. Restate the problem in more general terms.
4. Outline the steps to a solution.
5. Conclusion. Leave the reader with some food for thought. A motivational phrase works well.

Here’s a sample overview:
- Monday is the start of the week. Get it started right. Motivation and quick tips work well. People don’t have much time Monday but a quick pick-me-up is good.
- Friday culminates a week of hard work. So wrap up. Lists work well.
- Wednesday is work. People are generally busy on  Wednesdays so it’s not a great day to publish. If you do, content based on overcoming boundaries, sticking with it, or overcoming adversity work well.
- Tuesdays and Thursdays are great days for more informative posts. 
- Publish and market articles early in the morning. Breakfast time is a big window. Morning is a great time for information-rich posts or shares of quality information as people are getting a start on their productive day.
- Night-time is for entertainment. Infotainment posts work well when published at night. Wait until after dinnertime. I’ve found 7:30-9pm to be the best time for posting but it does change and is specific to your audience.
- Sunday morning is the best time to get people to read. This is when you publish your weekly recaps of the best articles and videos in your industry.


1. When your audience has nothing to do. For most this is first thing in the morning, lunchtime, and at night. For office workers, later on in the work day on Thursdays and Fridays is also good because that’s when people procrastinate.
2. When your audience is physiologically aroused. In a study performed by Jonah Berger, physiological arousal increased sharing from 33%-75%. If you can figure out when your audience goes to the gym or even a walk, share your viral materials right afterwards.
