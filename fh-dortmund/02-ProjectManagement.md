# Characteristic of R&D Projects
## Projects Basis - What is a project?
- A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result.
- Characteristics
    - Unique: not daily business
    - Endeavor: Has a specific purpose and target
    - Generating something new
    - Temporary: has a beginning and end
- Examples:
    - Good:Constructing an airport, Implementing a new business process
    - Bad: Producing frozen pizza, producing and distributing  electronics
- Rolling wave planning: planning changes overtime and adapts
- Project Field:
    - Product-related: Advanced engineering projects, Product Development projects, volume production support projects
    - General: Process optimization, ratio projects, infrastructure, localization projects and other projects

## Research and Development Basics
- Research:
    - Fundamental research: usually no projects, doing by big companies (small companies usually don't have enough budget)
    - Technology research: take the outcome of fundamental research and find a new application

- Development: 
    - Advanced technology development: think ahead, what will be used in 5-7 years
    - Product/Process development: know what to do and do it

- Value chain: Research (principle/concept) > Development (Application) > Production > Money
- Product related projects: focus also on the product life cycle
- Operation:
    - Ongoing
    - Repetitive
    - Part of organization's core business
    - Ramp-up phase: increase the volume, prototypes

## Project Management Basics – The Vocabulary
- Project: temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result. 
- Program: Group of related projects. Larger effort than a project and may also include operations.
- Portfolio: Project portfolio represents the entire investment in projects and programs and is aligned to the organization‘s strategic goal
![Example](images/prjmag-project-portafolio.png)

- Project Management:
    - Planning: Determination of TARGET value (deadline, cost, results)
    - Monitoring: Establishment of ACTUAL values, comparison TARGET-ACTUAL
    - Controlling: Analysis of discrepancies, introduction of measurements
- Project manager:
    - Organize: the one who decides what to do and when (initializing, execution and closing)
    - Integration: bring all the different disciplines on the table (communication, and high perspective view)

- Process: think of a process as a package of inputs, tools. Outputs from one process are often used as inputs into one or more processes and every process may be performed more than one time on a single process or even within a single phase (Examples in the SLIDES)

- Phases: create phases basically to control (tracking goals or check if something is feasible)  or as checkpoints. To split project into smaller piece, to design the structure of a project, to schedule decision gates, individually for each project ( no standard) and depends on project complexity. Parallel and overlapping phases are also possible (Examples in the SLIDES)

- Gates (Exit gate or kill point): Evaluation of deliverables of one project phase, determine if project should continue  and if next phase should be initiated and  take  the Go/No-Go Decision
- Life cycle: CHECK SLIDES

- Project Roles:
    - Project Manager: ultimately responsible for outcome, Formally empowered to use organizational resources, in control of the project, authorized to spend budget and to make decisions
    - Project Coordinator: Weaker than project manager, may not be allowed to make budget decisions, has some authority to reassign resources
    - Project Expeditor: staff assistant with little or no formal authority, making sure that things arrive on time and the tasks are completed on time
    - Sponsor: Person paying for the project, internal or external (costumer), Valuable project input (due dates, milestones, product features, constrains and assumptions)
    - Stakeholder: individuals who are involved in the project, has positive or negative impact, strong or weak influence, and the most important stakeholder is called "Key stakeholder"
    - Functional Manager: Department manager (head of engineering, director of marketing), "Own" the resources
    - Senior Management: Gives project manager authority and access to resources, resolves conflicts within the organization, issues strategic plans and goals, makes sure that company‘s projects are aligned with plans and goals and help prioritize projects.
    - Project Management Office: Department that supports project managers with Methodology, tools and training, ultimately controls all projects, defines standards and provides best practices.

- Project Context (Org, Influence, Skills): Every project has a context and it is heavily influenced by the type of organization in which it is performed (CHECK SLIDES)
    - Organizational structures: 
        - Functional: project coordination is done by the functional managers or line managers
        - Matrix:  based on responsibilities (Strong, weak, balanced)
        - Project oriented
    - Influence: depending on the organizational structures the influence or power lies functional manager and/or project manager.
    - Skills: Knowledge on project management, regulations/ standards, and project environment.

- Magic Triangle: Scope - Cost - Time
- Business case: 
    - Explains WHY a project is undertaken, the problem it will solve, and the benefit cost analysis
    - Reasons for undertaking a project: market demand, business need, costumer request, social need, ecological impact
    - Project Charter: Document that creates the project, signed by the Sponsor, gives Project Manager the authority to manage the project
    - Project Management Plan: Document that describe the management plan and there are several types (cost, schedule, scope, risk, configuration, quality, requirements plan)
    - Organizational Process Assets: All historical information or knowledge an organization has, which may be used to help. Organization Knowledge Base
    - Enterprise Environmental Factors: Any factor outside of the project’s control that influences the project (laws, government, culture)
    - Statement of work: Written description of the project’s product, service, or result. WHAT is to be done. While the project charter describes the project scope, the statement of work describes the product scope
    - Deliverables: Part of the product, or product itself  that is presented to the customer or stakeholder for acceptance
    - Milestones: A notable event in the project and can be a date, deliverable or a significant point of interest
- Baseline: he original plan PLUS any approved changes. Keep records that show how the plan has progressed and changed 
- Progressive elaboration: An iterative approach where planning occurs in cycles rather than up front. Do some planning, some execution, some monitoring and controlling, and repeat that cycle.
    - Rolling wave planning: A planning technique that does not seek the answer all questions or plan all project activities at the beginning, Instead, only immanent project activities are planned in detail, while activities further are planned at a higher level.
- Lessons learned: Documents focused on variances / deviations that are created at the end of each phase. Lessons learned from past projects are another organizational asset

# Project Management Processes
- 9 Knowledge Areas (PMI)
    - Integration
    -Scope
    - Time
    - Cost
    - Quality
    - Human Resource
    - Communication
    - Risk
    - Procurement
