# Introduction
- Characteristics
    - Unique
    - Generating something now
    - Temporary: has a beginning and end
    - Has a specific purpose and target

- Rolling wave planning: planning changes overtime and adapts

# Research and development
- Research:
    - Fundamental research: usually no projects, doing by big companies (small companies usually don't have enough budget)
    - Technology research: take the outcome of fundamental research and find a new application

- Development: 
    - Advance technology: think ahead, what will be used in 5-7 years
    - Product development: know what to do and do it

- Product related projects: focus also on the product life cycle

# Operations
- Ramp-up phase: increase the volume, prototypes

# Project Management
- Organize: the one who decides what to do and when
- Integration: bring all the different disciplines on the table
- Process: take care of the process
- Phases: create phases basically to control (tracking goals or check if something is feasible)  or as checkpoints
    - Gates: evaluation of deliverables, GO/ NO-GO decision

# Project Manager
- Matrix organization: based on responsibilities, line manager = functional manager
- Quality in terms of PM is related to how many requirements are meet
- Business case: It's always the base of the project, reasons for understanding the project
- Baseline: original plan. if the plan changes, the new plan becomes the baseline

- Project manager plan: 
    - Project related (no details)
- Scope management:
    - Gold planing: expand time in  extra but "cool" features that the costumer is not paying for

- Define scope:
    - the better the requirements the less effort is done here
