# Introduction
Reasons for project success:
    - Without result: a manager or someone changes the status of the project as _closed_ or _finished_.
    - Realistic expectation: user and management views. The  user may ask for something that it is not possible under certain circumstances.
    - Clear statement of requirements
    - Management support 
    - Experience project manager
- Motivation: 
    - legal perspective: contracts
    - keep the supply chain working

## What is a requirement
- Requirements are presented in  natural language:
    - everybody can understand it
    - it is powerful, UML cannot model quality for example.
    - user are most likely to not understand UML
    - But natural language may be unclear
- A requirement is:
    - a need of the user or stakeholder
    - a capability or property that a system shall have.
- **def**: Soren Lausen: “A requirement specification is a document that describes what the system should do.”
- It is given from the perspective of the system (check examples in slides for more information).
- What and how depends on the perspective. It is not always easy to identify requirements.
- Requirements talk about real word, what the user can observe
- Some requirements are not visible to the system.
- **Specifications**: 
    - Are things that the system can observed and it is also observed in the real world.
    - Are implementable
    - Should meet the requirements, the assumptions can be wrong
- **Functional Requirement**: 
    - explains the what
    -  A requirement concerning a result of behavior that shall be provided by a function of a system.
- **Quality Requirement**: 
    - How good? How can you specify reliability and maintainability
    - How to measure so we make sure we meet the requirements
    - A requirement that related to a quality concern that is not covered by functional requirement
 
## Constrains 
- Requirement gives to much room, so we must constrain the requirement
- Additional constrains that are not covered by functional requirements

## What is requirements engineering
- A systematic approach for delivering requirements 
- **Goal**: minimize the risk of delivering a system that does not meet the stakeholders’ desires and needs
- Ingredients:
    - Knowing your stakeholders 
    - understanding the stakeholders’ needs
    - achieving a consensus among the stakeholders about requirements
    - documenting them according to given standards
    - managing them systematically to cope with changes
- Is an informal process, it is hard to subdivide in procedures
- It is a phase, it is a continuous activity
- It is a part of the software development life cycle
- It is the basics for  verification
- Traceability is very helpful to decide whether the software development may change due to new requirements 

## Some empirical data
- Misconception or misunderstanding in the requirements phase are the main cause of failures in the test phase. 

# RE in a nutshell (No slides)
## Where do RE come from?
- from stakeholders

## Who analyzes the requirements

## Project Type
- In-house: requirements are there
- Product dev: new product for a market
- Time and materials:
    - built a customer with effort
    - External company gives the order to develop a product
    - It's to risky
- COTS (commercial off the shelf): 
    - somebody is selling something to you
    - Need high level requirement engineering to systematically evaluates products
- Tender: company selects supplier in a bidding process
- Contract dev: third-parties companies develop parts of the software
- Unknown: no idea what to do

## System types

## Corner stones of RE
- 3x3 Model:
    - Activities: 
        - Research information
        - design, decision making
    - Documentation:
        - What the system is actually doing
        - requirements vs specifications

## Communications
- Noise, infer what other people is trying to say
- Not all the information is given
- Neuro linguistic programming 

## Documentation
- What the user wants
