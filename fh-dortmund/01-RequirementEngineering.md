# Introduction
- Without result: a manager or someone changes the status of the project as _closed_ or _finished_.
- Realistic expectation: user and management views. The  user may ask for something that it is not possible under certain circumstances.
- Motivation: 
    - legal perspective: contracts
    - keep the supply chain working

## What is a requirement
- Requirements are presented in  natural language:
    - everybody can understand it
    - it is powerful, UML cannot model quality for example.
    - user are most likely to not understand UML
    - But natural language may be unclear
- A requirement is a need that the user or stakeholder needs. 
- It is given from the perspective of the system (check slides for more information).
- What and how depends on the perspective. It is not always easy to identify requirements.
- Requirements talk about real word, what the user can observe
- Some requirements are not visible to the system.
- **Specifications**: 
    - Are things that the system can observed and it is also observed in the real world.
    - Are implementable
    - Should meet the requirements, the assumptions can be wrong

- **Functional Requirement**: explains the what
- **Quality Requirement**: 
    - How good? How can you specify reliability and maintainability
    - How to measure so we make sure we meet the requirements
    - A requirement that related to a quality concern that is not covered by functional requirement
 
## Constrains 
- Requirement gives to much room, so we must constrain the requirement
- Additional constrains that are not covered by functional requirements

## What is requirements engineering
- A systematic approach for delivering requirements 
- Is an informal process, it is hard to subdivide in procedures
- It is a phase, it is a continuous activity
- It is a part of the software development life cycle
- It is the basics for  verification
- Traceability is very helpful to decide whether the software development may change due to new requirements 

## Some empirical data
- Misconception or misunderstanding in the requirements phase are the main cause of failures in the test phase.
