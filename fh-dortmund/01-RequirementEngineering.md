# Introduction
- Without result: a manager or someone changes the status of the project as _closed_ or _finished_.
- Realistic expectation: user and management views. The  user may ask for something that it is not possible under certain circumstances.
- Motivation: 
    - legal perspective: contracts
    - keep the supply chain working

## What is a requirement
- Requirements are presented in  natural language:
    - everybody can understand it
    - it is powerful, UML cannot model quality for example.
    - user are most likely to not understand UML
    - But natural language may be unclear
- A requirement is a need that the user or stakeholder needs. 
- It is given from the perspective of the system (check slides for more information).
- What and how depends on the perspective. It is not always easy to identify requirements.
- Requirements talk about real word, what the user can observe
- Some requirements are not visible to the system.
- **Specifications**: 
    - Are things that the system can observed and it is also observed in the real world.
    - Are implementable
    - Should meet the requirements, the assumptions can be wrong
