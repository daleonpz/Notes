# Introduction
- Typically have communications with people and other systems
- is the main driver for the industries
- **Embedded systems**: software embedded into a technical system which interacts with the world on a specific hardware
- **Embedded software engineering** is a multidisciplinary approach for developing Solutions to complex engineering problems.

- Hard real-time: result must be delivered to the systems in a specific time, otherwise it will have terrible consequences.

## System characteristics
- Reactive systems: automatically sensing and reacting to the environment
