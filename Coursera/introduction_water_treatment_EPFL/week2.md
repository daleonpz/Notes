# A Framework for Water Safety
what does safety mean?
* There is always a risk in any activity
* The question is then what level of risk is acceptable

**Safe drinking water** is that which  does not represent any significant risk to health over liftime of consumption. 

* Health-based targets: acceptable level of risk
* Water safety plan: risk identification and management
* Verification: Water quality measurement

Water quality measurement is different to water safety, water quality measurements in general just measure the number of e.coli bacterias.

## Conventional treatment processes
* Resource protection
* Pretreatment (reservoirs)
* Coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation 
* Filtration: good for large pathogens
* Primary disinfection: chlorine is the most used
* Distribution

## Conventional treatment at Household level
* Sedimentation: coagulation
* Filtration: ceramic, biosand, membrane
* Disinfection: chlorine, uv, heat
* Safe storage: appropiate container, hygienic location

# Sedimentation
* It is a preliminary step
* allows subsequent treatment steps to be more effective 
* Turbidity
    * suspended large particles in water
    * there are no health based target
    * it may have an impact in the following stages
* Gravity settling
    * depends on the size of the particles
    * have a very limited effectiveness in pathogens removal
    * very common method: three-pot sedimentation
* Coagulation
    * enhanced settling
    * wake particles stick to each other
    * removes some dissolved compounds, improves colour
* Plant-based coagulation
    * Moringa oleifera (africa and asia)
    * Prickly pear cactus (latin america)
    * nirmali seeds (india)
    * may have some antibacterial properties 
    * add carbon (may help bacterias to growth) and oleour
* Chemical coagulants
    * Aluminium sulphate
    * Alum potash
    * Ferric salts
    * Coarser flac, settler faster but larger volumes
* In order to have an effective coagulation we must perform some test to get right proportion

# Membrane Filtration
* Rapidly growing field 
* Size exclusion
* Electrostatic effects, positives/ negatives particles interact with the membrane
* Biological activity
* Different types
    * cloth filtration
        * sand, insects
    * micro filtration: 
        * requires more pressure to make the water pass through
        * bacterias, protozoa
    * ultra filtration
        * requires more pressure than micro filtration
        * viruses
    * nano filtration
        * may exclude all pathogens and macro molecules
    * reverse osmosis
        * removes small ions
* Membrane fouling
    * result of particle retention, bacterial growth 
    * increase in operating pressure
    * solution: periodic cleaning 

# Ceramic Filtration
* Simple operation
* Built-in safe storage
* No electricity or consumables
* Can be produced locally
* Quality control
    * Visual inspection (no cracks)
    * Audio test or ping test
    * Pressure testing
    * Flow rate testing
    * Microbiological testing
    * Failure rate (10-20)%
* Electrostatic removal
    * virus have negative charges
    * Possibility of saturation
* Virus removal is poor in general
* Coating with silver since it is antibacterial
* Arsenic, presented in clay, may go into the water
* Requires periodic cleaning
* Good against protozoas, bacterias may regrowth

# Biological filtration
* Most known: slow sand filtration
* recent adaptation to household level
* biofilm fights pathogens
* Slow sand filtration
    * Water column and a sand bed
    * Continuous flow
* Biological layer takes time to develop (one month)
* No backwashing
* Need low turbidity
* Important to use the filter each day
* Biofilm needs to be wet always
* Turbidity reduction 85-90%
* Iron reduction 90-95%
