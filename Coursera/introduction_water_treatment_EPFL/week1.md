# Outline
* Background
* Disease
* Contamination

# Global Burden of Disease
Disease classification based on Bradley classification:
* Water-borne: drinking water with pathogens (cholera, polio, hepatits A). Control mechanisms: improve water quality
* Water-washed: poor hygine (dirty hands). Control mechanisms: improve water quality
* Water-based: parasites that lives in water (dengue, bilharzia). Control mechanisms: Target aquatic organism host, protect surface water bodies
* Water-related: insect which breed in water (mosquitos - malaria/dengue). Control mechanisms: remove habitat

# Daly( Disability Adjusted life years):
Daly = YLL + YLD
* YLL (years of life lost): number of deaths x standard life expectancy at age of death in years
* YLI (years of life witd Disabilities): number of incident case x disability weight x average duration of the case

# Water-borne pathogens
## Classes 
* Helminths: 1000 um, larvae in insect host
* Protozoa: one cell (10-50 um), most are parasites, can form resistant crysts
* Bacterias: 2 um, do not contain nucleus 
* Viruses: 0.1 um, can only live/ reproduce in living hosts
