# Outline
* Background
* Disease
* Contamination

# Global Burden of Disease
Disease classification based on Bradley classification:
* Water-borne: drinking water with pathogens (cholera, polio, hepatits A). Control mechanisms: improve water quality
* Water-washed: poor hygine (dirty hands). Control mechanisms: improve water quality
* Water-based: parasites that lives in water (dengue, bilharzia). Control mechanisms: Target aquatic organism host, protect surface water bodies
* Water-related: insect which breed in water (mosquitos - malaria/dengue). Control mechanisms: remove habitat

# Daly( Disability Adjusted life years):
Daly = YLL + YLD
* YLL (years of life lost): number of deaths x standard life expectancy at age of death in years
* YLI (years of life witd Disabilities): number of incident case x disability weight x average duration of the case

# Water-borne pathogens
## Classes 
* Helminths: 1000 um, larvae in insect host
* Protozoa: one cell (10-50 um), most are parasites, can form resistant crysts
* Bacterias: 2 um, do not contain nucleus 
* Viruses: 0.1 um, can only live/ reproduce in living hosts

# How does water become unsafe
* microbial safety
* indicators faecal contamination
* f-diagrams
* chemical safety

# Common faecal indicators
* total coliforms: not useful for faecal indicators, can be useful for operation monitor (effectiveness of treatment)
* thermotolerant coliforms: some indication of non-faecal sources, may grow or die off at ambient indicator
* E. coli: most suitable indicator for faecal contamination   

- There is no a very clear correlation between pathogens and bacterias.
- Using sanitary inspections score as well as E.coli level will give a better understanding of water  quality.

## Other indicators
* coliphage viruses
* faecal streptococci
* bacterial spores

# The F-diagram
Shows how faecal pathogens can be distributed in the environment, and be ingested by a host

# Opportunities for contamination
* water resource: contaminated by faecals or minerals
* delivery system: broken pipes 
* collection and transport: unclean manipulation of water
* household storage: open containers 
* consumption: unclean glass of water, dirty hands

# What is HWTS?
* Household water treatment and safe storage
    * Pre-treatment: Removal of suspended solids, turbidity (rough filtration, sedimentation)
    * Filtration: efficient to remove big pathogens (protozoas and some bacterias). Need maintenance, and possibility of recontamination
    * Disinfection: boiling (needs fuel, vulnerable to recontamination), UV radiation (cannot kill all the pathogens), chlorine (efficient after longer times ~30 min)
* Safe storage
* Effectiveness
* Efficiency
* Advantages and disadvantages
