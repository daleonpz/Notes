- **Reciprocity bias** describes the impulse to reciprocate actions others have done towards us. The desire to return favors, pay back debts and treat others well could have been a decisive evolutionary advantage for humans as it engenders cooperation. However, reciprocity bias can also work in reverse â€” in response to unfriendly actions, people will deliver back other unfriendly actions!

- **Innocuous Commitment**: people tends to keep consistence. For example:
    - _first commitment_
    - A: would you be willing to donate blood?
    - B: sure, I could do that

    - _consistency_ (ask again after a couple of days)
    - A: can you come this Wednesday at the Hospital to donate blood?
    - B: yes, I'll be there (the answer was consistent with the first commitment)

- **unconscious incubation**: you keep searching for a solution to problem in the background without even think about it. 

- **social proof**: you are likely to do the same that people, you think are similar to you, do

- **Liking**: it's very probable that you will say YES to people you like

- **Authority**: authority has a lot of influence in decision making
