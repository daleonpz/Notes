- **Reciprocity bias** describes the impulse to reciprocate actions others have done towards us. The desire to return favors, pay back debts and treat others well could have been a decisive evolutionary advantage for humans as it engenders cooperation. However, reciprocity bias can also work in reverse â€” in response to unfriendly actions, people will deliver back other unfriendly actions!

- **Innocuous Commitment**: people tends to keep consistence. For example:
    - _first commitment_
    - A: would you be willing to donate blood?
    - B: sure, I could do that

    - _consistency_ (ask again after a couple of days)
    - A: can you come this Wednesday at the Hospital to donate blood?
    - B: yes, I'll be there (the answer was consistent with the first commitment)

- **unconscious incubation**: you keep searching for a solution to problem in the background without even think about it. 

- **social proof**: you are likely to do the same that people, you think are similar to you, do

- **Liking**: it's very probable that you will say YES to people you like

- **Authority**: authority has a lot of influence in decision making

- Build relationships not treat people trading objects

- Soft skills are harder to learn but more important overall

- **Priming effect** is a technique whereby exposure to one stimulus influences a response to a subsequent stimulus, without conscious guidance or intention. For example, the word NURSE is recognized more quickly following the word DOCTOR than following the word BREAD. 

- **Anchoring effect** is a cognitive bias where an individual relies too heavily on an initial piece of information offered (considered to be the "anchor") when making decisions. For example, if you see a car that costs 10K USD you will think _it's too expensive_, if you come some time later and you see the same but now it costs 5K USD, you will think _what such a great deal, I cannot miss this opportunity_. But in reality the car costs 3K USD.

- **Mirroring** but in terms of conversation is as simple as repeating the last three words the other person just said. This will trigger the _paraphrasing chip_ on the other person brain.

- Negotiations is not about winning or losing, it's about make the other person feel good about his/her choice.
